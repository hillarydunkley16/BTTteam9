# Michelin Mobility Intelligence Machine Learning Challenge Project (Break Through Tech AI Program)
Check out my team's project repository for the real-world ML project we worked on for Michelin from August-December 2024, as part of the Break Through Tech AI Program's Fall 2024 AI Studio!

Road Safety Intelligence with Augmented LLM

Challenge Summary: Make geospatial analysis more user friendly through the use of chatbots and LLMs, making map/graph generation and querying more accessible and intuitive when it comes to Michelin data products. This will help public authorities and B2B businesses reduce crashes and deaths on roads.
